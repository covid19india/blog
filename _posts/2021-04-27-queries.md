Hi all, hope this post finds you in good health. Since the covid situation in India has become pretty severe, we've started off a medical help telegram group where doctors provide guidance to patients and common people about covid. The following set of questions have been picked from the group. Please go through them to get a better understanding about topics like vaccination, personal care, recovery, covid symptoms and treatment.

In case you have additional queries, please ask them here: [https://t.me/CovidMedHelp](https://t.me/CovidMedHelp)

#### Vaccination queries

**Last year my father tested positive for covid and he also suffered from pulmonary embolism (blood clots in lungs). This year first dose of vaccine has been administered. Seeing the reports of blood clots in are cases, should we go ahead with second dose for him?**  
Yes, he can take the vaccine. The risk of blood clots from the vaccine is much much lower than the risk of blood clots from covid infection itself. Hence it is definitely an acceptable risk, and is advisable to get the vaccine.

**My wife is pregnant. Can she take the vaccine?**  
This is still a matter of consideration. As per the latest CDC guidelines overseas, they are advising pregnant women to get vaccinated. But such an advisory has not been issued in India. Keeping this in mind, we would advise for a wait and watch policy as of now.

**I am senior citizen and i have to take second vaccine after 6-8 weeks. In case two or three days are over 8 weeks, can i take second vaccine or I have to repeat the course again?**  
You can take the second dose. No need to start a repeat course of vaccination if you are a few days late.

**Both my son and daughter in law were Covid 19 +ve two weeks ago and they have recovered well. What would you suggest apart from taking covid precaution. Also need advice on vaccination for them (both are 28/29 years old).**  
Covid routine precautions are still to be practiced. And for vaccination our ministry of health says that after 14 days of recovery from covid one can take the vaccine. Recovering from COVID -19 confers natural immunity to an individual for a median of 3-6 months. You can delay vaccination by a month or two for them now. However, it is advisable to give them the vaccine a month or so after full recovery.

**My mother is on arthritis medication right now can she take the vaccine?**  
She can take the vaccine, some of the drugs used in arthritis might decrease the vaccine efficiency but itâ€™s still much better to get vaccine.

**Can I take covid vaccine? I'm taking dutasteride 0.5mg daily for my prostate.**  
Yes, you can take the vaccine.

**I have one query regarding the behaviour of the vaccine. Does the first dose of vaccine increase any sort of immunity? Or we need both the doses to get things work.**  
The first dose may give a small degree of immunity, but as per the trials, for most vaccines, you will need to take both doses to get the maximum protection from the shot.

**Hello, my mother in law had a mild stroke in 2018. Since then she is on blood thinners (Ecosprin75/Atrova40). She is also diabetic and has high pressure problem. We are not sure if she can be vaccinated. Please advise.**  
She can be vaccinated. Ecosprin is not a higher category blood thinner. Patients on other drugs like warfarin, acitrom, rivaroxaban, apixaban, etc may need to seek the advice of their healthcare provider before taking the vaccine. But those on lower potency blood thinners like Ecosprin may not worry.

**My wife undergone angioplasty in 2012 takes ecospirin 75 per day, can we take vaccine with such low dose of ecosprin?**  
Yes, can take the vaccine

**My father is asthamatic from past 30 years. Is it safe to get the vaccine?**  
Yes, it is safe to take the vaccine.

#### Medical queries ####

**Our family tested positive in September, now again we are having slight symptoms like headache, body pains, fever (99.6F), but tested negative in rapid test, please suggest the appropriate steps to take.**  
Book an RTPCR just to be on the safe side. Isolate yourselves till you get the report. Take multivitamins with Zinc and vitamin C and vitamin D on a daily basis. Take paracetamol 650mg for fever and body pain and monitor your blood oxygen levels. As long as oxygen saturation stays in the normal range (96-100%), no need to worry.

**I tested positive on 4th Nov and negative on 14th Nov Can I donate plasma now?**  
I would recommend against it as it has been more than 3 months now, so the level of antibodies in your plasma will not be enough to make a difference. As a general rule, you can donate convalescent plasma 14 to 90 days after recovering from the virus. It is best to donate plasma as soon as you are eligible, as the level of antibodies slowly goes down over time.

**From last night, I felt that my smellling sense is going. No other problem. Could it be covid symptoms. If yes so what shoud I do?**  
Sudden loss of sense of smell is not a common thing. The only common cause right now is covid-19. Isolate yourself, monitor your pulse and oxygen saturation and get RT-PCR and rapid test done.

**I got infected on the 13th of April . Experienced loss of smell, loss of taste, fever and loss of appetite, Now I regained all, but mild cough is there. What should I do?**  
The cough will resolve over time. You can do steam inhalation and gargles with turmeric & salty water thrice a day for now, as you are already on the road to recovery. You will need to stay in isolation for 14 days and then gradually go to back to your routine, some dry cough and fatigue might might continue for a few days.

**Is Fabiflu (Favipiravir) recommend to a covid+ve person?**  
It has been given permission by the drug regulatory authorities for use in trial mode. As of now its effectiveness is still under investigation, but it is being prescribed by many doctors for treatment of mild-moderate infections.

**My brothers oxygen level is 89 to 90% and no hospital is ready to take him in, what should I do?**  
Please make him lie in prone position, and keep monitoring oxygen saturation. Try to consult a doctor in person and arrange a bed, or at least oxygen at home as per the advice of your local physician.

**Hello doctor from last two days I am getting fever body pains for sometimes and stop than again coming next day this is Corona or viral fever**  
Kindly self isolate yourself and monitor your symptoms closely. If they persist, get an RT-PCR and an antigen test done. In the meanwhile, you may take tablet paracetamol 500 as needed for contolling the fever.

**Dear doctors, my father is diabetic. His antigen test is negative. His SPO2 level is 86. Please suggest what we should do.**  
If SpO2 is 86% persistently, plan to get an HRCT done and take him to a hospital. Meanwhile, ask him to lie on his stomach in prone position as long as possible.

**Is 96% oxygen saturation good for my father? He is 55 and is diabetic.**  
Yes, it is normal

**Can CT scan be used as a diagnostic tool for Covid19?**  
CT scan along with symptoms and other lab reports can be decided upon by your doctor for hospitalisation. Consult a doctor so they can use a combination of clinical signs, symptoms and tests to make the diagnosis

**Hello doctor, I am having cough, fever since last 3 days, suspecting covid. RT-PCR facility is not available in my town, but HRCT is available. After how many days from first symptom, should I get HRCT done for myself?**  
CT scan is not mandatory if RT PCR is not available. Given the current pandemic, these symptoms should be treated as presumptive COVID unless proven otherwise. At least try getting the basic lab investigations like CBC with ESR, CRP, D dimer, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin and SGOT done. Also most importantly, please isolate yourself and make sure you do not transmit the infection to your loved ones. Keep a watch on oxygen saturation, pulse, blood pressure and temperature.

**I am 4 months pregnant. My husband tested COVID positive 4 days back. And I am having fever, cough, body ache for two days. I am self isolating currently. Please advise me what to do ?**  
Please remain in isolation and consult your obstetrician as well. Monitor your symptoms and vital signs like oxygen saturation closely, get blood tests done as advised by your physician and obstetrician, and do breathing exercises, steam inhalation etc in the meanwhile.

#### Post Recovery 

**How long does it take to fully recover from covid? Been 18 days now for me and I have body and joint aches in my entire body. Plus weakness is crazy, focusing anywhere is a challenge.**  
Depends on severity, some symptoms may go on for weeks. A few patients report having symptoms months after the infection, which is known as Long Covid syndrome. Such a patient may not be infective but may have persistent, low grade symptoms. There is no specific treatment for this, except taking symptomatic medication like paracetamol, cough syrup as needed, breathing exercises etc. Recovery takes time. Check oxygen saturation and if it's normal than no need to worry. The body takes some time to recover from infection.

**When do we consider someone recovered from Covid?**  
Consider the patient to be recovered around 14 days after the diagnosis is made.

**I have tested negative for covid now but I have still not recovered my sense of taste and smell. Is it normal?**  
Yes, it is normal. You should get your sense of smell and taste back slowly over a period of time.

#### Personal care ####

**I got Covid19 earlier. If I get the infection again, will it be more severe?**  
There are a few reports of reinfection, but there is no indication if reinfection will be mild or severe. And with the existence of multiple variants and the constant evolution of the virus, there is no way to predict for sure. There is an old credo: Prevention is the best cure. It is best is to take all precautions to ensure that you are not infected again, use masks properly always, distancing and santitisers.

**Have a small query can we take any medicine even though we don't have any symptoms? As a matter of precaution?**  
You can take multivitamins with Zinc and vitamin C and vitamin D for precautionary measure. You can wear an n95 mask in public, practice physical distancing and frequent handwashing with soap or sanitizer. Prevention is the best cure.

**Can we take Fabiflu (Favipiravir) per day as safety measures?**  
No. All medicines have side effects. Favipiravir only has emergency approval for covid because there are few alternatives. It is not advisable to take experimental medicines like this by yourself.

**How can we isolate someone at home?**  
Confine them to a dedicated room and bathroom, they should not come out and interact with others at home, give food and water to the person in room without coming into direct contact, like by keeping it near the door, give them a pulse oximeter to monitor, if person is elderly and canâ€™t take care of themselves, or have difficulty doing so, a dedicated caregiver with N95 mask, distancing as much as possible, and frequently sanitizing hands may look after them.

**What precautions do you need to take if someone in your building has come positive and you have a common pathway of going in and out of the building?**  
Wear a mask (preferebly an N95 mask) properly at all times while in the public areas. Avoid touching common surfaces unnecessarily and wash hands with soap or sanitise them with alcohol based sanitizer after coming into contact with such surfaces.
